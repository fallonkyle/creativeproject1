      <h2>The Failure of Trump's Tariffs</h2>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>For over a year now, President Trump has been placing tariffs on Chinese imported goods, with retaliation resulting in tariffs being placed on American goods that flow into China. The main reason for this is because of
        unfair
        trade practices and because of the large trade deficit that the US has with China. Action is needed to fix the unfair trade practices of China, but Trump’s use of tariffs as an attempt to fix the problem only creates more problems. The use of
        tariffs lead to the expanse of more tariffs, leading to a trade war that will ultimately end with not one, but both countries getting hurt. This is basic Macroeconomic principle. Tariffs seldom work, and Trump’s tariffs are no different.
        Trump’s tariffs are hurting American consumers and businesses; therefore, a new method to fix our trade problem with China should be sought out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>First off, let me clear up what the real problem with trade with China is. It is NOT the trade deficit, but China’s lack of acknowledging intellectual property rights. A basic Macroeconomics class teaches that there is a
        balance of trade when
        foreign trade occurs. When a country has a trade surplus, it tends to use that extra money to invest in the other country through direct foreign investment, giving the money back to the country it was trading with. A trade deficit is not
        inherently bad, but what is inherently bad is the failure of a country to observe intellectual property rights of a private entity and steal the use of its inventions/creations. Now that that’s cleared up, let’s discuss how tariffs are a bad
        solution to issues with trade.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>The average American consumer and business is expected to pay more on products as a direct result of Trump’s tariffs. In a Forbes article, Senior Contributor Stuart Anderson cites a recent study from the National Foundation
        for American Policy
        that claims all the tariffs to go into effect by the end of 2019, “‘On an annual basis...will cost the average household $2,031 per year….’” This is clear evidence that the tariffs will take a toll on consumers, and if Trump decides to place
        more tariffs, that number will go up, costing families even more. Businesses are also susceptible to economic damage from the tariffs. A trade advocacy group called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland claims Trump’s tariffs cost U.S. businesses $3.4
        billion in June alone, representing a $2.4 billion increase from what businesses paid the year before in June (Dhue). This increase in input costs has led to many businesses needing to raise their prices, which then leads to a fall in sales.
        Reports from General Motors and Ford say that Trump’s tariffs have cost them $1 billion each, which will likely result in price increases on cars in order for those companies to maintain good profits. Even if it is true that Chinese
        businesses
        are suffering from the tariffs that Trump has placed, we should not need to sacrifice the well-being of our own consumers and businesses to beat out China.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>Some may claim that Trump’s tariffs are to help our domestic industry, but they in fact hurt our industries more than they help them. Many economists and business leaders point out that the ratio of steel-consuming
        industries
        and
        steel-producing ones is 80:1, suggesting that there are way more industries that are hurt by the tariffs than are helped (Long). The tariffs cause the price of steel and aluminum to rise, hurting those steel and aluminum-using industries by
        making them pay more for their input costs, while only helping a few steel and aluminum-producing companies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>A better solution than tariffs is to change global trade rules. This action would look like forming “...a pact in which signatories commit to open trade and investment regimes, sufficiently strong intellectual property
        rights
        and enforcement,
        and legal recourse mechanisms. Most importantly, signatories commit to not engage in trade or investment with state-owned enterprises or those with close ties to state-owned enterprises (McDaniel).” If we worked with our allies, we could
        pressure China to change their practices in order to have access to more trade, helping protect future trade. We’re not the only ones upset with China’s unfair trade practices, and it would be foolish to inhibit that trade, so the most
        effective way to fix this wrong would be to give them the opportunity for better and more trade on the condition that they fix their trade practices.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>China is a great market for many American business, and we don’t want to lose that market, but in order to preserve the intellectual property of our businesses, we must take action to force China to fix its trade practices.
        With the help of our
        allies and others who are upset with China’s trade practices, we can pressure them to join in on a pact that is committed to free trade and the preservation of strong intellectual property rights. In the case that China says no to such a
        pact,
        efforts can be made to change our trading and conduct more trading with other countries that are more likely to respect the rights of American businesses’ intellectual property. There is no need to use tariffs and get the US involved in a
        trade
        war that will lead to nothing but both sides getting hurt with no real results produced. The President ought to listen to his economic advisors and develop a better plan to deal with China’s unfair trade.</p>
