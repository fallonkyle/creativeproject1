      <p class='standard'>My name is Kyle Fallon, and I'm a freshman at Brigham
        Young University. I am super interested in politics, and I usually try to
        stay updated on the political news. Since middle school, I've always been
        interested in political topics like the minimum wage and gun control.</p>

      <p class='standard'>My dad was a Republican, which has influenced
        my thought process and stance on political issues, but as a party, I do not
        like the Republican party. I feel that they are wrong on several social issues,
        and that their political priorities are messed up.</p>

    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>I took a world and U.S. government and politics class last
        year in high school, which has greatly improved my knowledge on the interworkings
        of U.S. politics and the politics that goes on in several different countries.
        One of the countries we studied was Iran, which is why I made a paper arguing
        for greater efforts of diplomacy with Iran.</p>
