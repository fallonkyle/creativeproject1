      <h2>The Misconceptions Between US-Iran Relations</h2>
    </div>

    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>In November of 1979, in the wake of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Iranian students seized control of the US embassy in Tehran, where American hostages were kept for 444 days. This was kickstarted by President Jimmy Carter
        allowing the ill Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, to come to the United States to receive cancer treatment. An anti-Shah cleric named Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had already been criticizing the Shah publicly for a multitude of
        grievances, such as secularizing Iran, and the US taking in the Shah was the final straw for the many Iranians who had heard the words of Khomeini. Khomeini saw the Shah as a puppet of the West, and the events that took place during the
        Islamic Revolution were all to cast out Western influence and re-introduce Islamic elements into society and government. The Shah was overthrown and a new Constitution was soon after created, combining Islamic elements into government and
        creating the theocracy Iran has today.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>Since then, the United States and Iran has had a troubling history for the past several decades. Even before the Islamic Revolution, the US has had toxic interactions with Iran with the coup d’etat of Muhammed Mossadegh, an
        operation staged by the CIA. Mossadegh was deposed, and put in his place was the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah who many Iranians viewed as a puppet of the West. Considering the CIA-backed coup d’etat, it’s probably
        justified for the Iranian citizens at the time to think that the Shah was a puppet of the West.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>The United States has been worried about the threat Iran poses to the security of the nation and the world for a while, with the average American worrying about Iran developing nuclear weapons for over a decade now.
        According to a Gallup poll taken in 2019 of February 1-10, 72% of Americans view the development of nuclear weapons by Iran as a critical threat to the vital interests of the US in the next 10 years. Another Gallup poll from July 2019 shows
        that 63% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned that the US will not do enough to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, while a 2006 Gallup poll asking the same question reported 67% of Americans who were either
        very concerned or somewhat concerned that the US will not do enough to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Public opinion shows that well over half the country is worried about Iran developing nuclear weapons, and has worried about
        it for over a decade.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>Are our poor thoughts of Iran justified? Our poor history with Iran cannot be changed, but we can change the future of our political relationship. Our relationship with Iran does not have to stay gloomy and negative, and we
        can improve it if we gain a greater understanding of the history between the US and Iran, and if we learn to understand the culture of Iran to learn how they think and react. Diplomacy is the key to improving our political relationship with
        Iran.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>To better understand Iran, we must understand some elements of the Iranian culture. They have a slightly revolutionary culture, which can be seen from the Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911 and the Islamic Revolution.
        One of the hardest things to grasp as Americans is that the Iranian government is a theocracy, combining religious elements within the government. The Constitution created after the Islamic Revolution has multiple sections that are dedicated
        to secular and religious elements of their government (Powell). What’s especially difficult is that the religion they include in their government is Shi’a Islam. Many Americans have many misconceptions about Islam, and this lack of
        understanding of Islam contributes to why we have little understanding of Iranians and the Islamic Revolution. In order to foster better relations with Iran in the future, we must respect those elements as best as we can.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>An argument one could make is that Iran isn’t worth our respect after the events of the Iran Hostage Crisis, an event taking place from 1979 to 1981, in which the US embassy in Tehran, Iran’s capital, was seized and 52
        hostages were held for over a year (Britannica). The embassy takeover was prompted when President Carter allowed the ill Shah to come to the United States to receive cancer treatment. There was initially no response, but about two weeks
        later, a mob of a few thousand stormed the embassy, taking the American men and women in it hostage. The problem that kept becoming worse and worse was the presence of the United States in the affairs of Iran, and the US allowing the Shah to
        seek refuge in its borders during the Islamic Revolution was the final straw. To the Iranians, it had become clear that the United States was deep in the affairs of Iran, and that needed to change. In one of the negotiations for the hostages
        between Iran and the US, the acting foreign minister Abolhasan Bani-Sadr called for the US to cease interfering in Iranian affairs in order to get the hostages back (Britannica). The hostage situation would’ve been less likely if we didn’t
        interfere in Iranian affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>The Iranians were seeking to throw out the Shah at the beginning of the Islamic Revolution. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who was one of the largest critics of the Shah, was exiled from Iran in 1964 for speaking harshly
        against one of the Shah’s reform programs, but he continued to preach in exile against the evil Pahlavi regime (Afary). In the 1970s, thousands of tapes and print copies of Khomeini’s speeches were smuggled into the country, which spoke out
        against some of the policies of the Shah, such as “The Shah’s dependence on the United States, his close ties with Israel… and his regime’s ill-considered economic policies (Afary)....” Another thing the Shah was criticized for was the
        modernization of Iran. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the modernization in Iran is explained, in which we read, “But in little more than a generation, Iran had changed from a traditional, conservative, and rural society to one that was
        industrial, modern, and urban. The sense that in both agriculture and industry too much had been attempted too soon and that the government, either through corruption or incompetence, had failed to deliver all that was promised was manifested
        in demonstrations against the regime in 1978 (Britannica).” Demonstrations started erupting around the country soon after many Iranians became dissident about the Shah for various reasons. These dissidents were working-poor, unemployed,
        clergy, landowners, secular intellectuals, and merchants (Afary); all these different social classes became united, eventually leading to the Islamic Revolution in 1979. With all that support, it was clear to the Shah that he needed to flee
        Iran, and it maybe should’ve been clear to us that helping the deposed Iranian leader receive medical treatment in the United States would result in terrible consequences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>To make up for our actions, we need to seek out diplomatic opportunities with Iran so that we can help foster better relations in the present and the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>A great example of diplomacy with Iran was the creation of the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal, in which Iran agreed to cease its operation of creating nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of billions of dollars in sanctions.
        On Iran’s side, these negotiations were done in part by Hassan Rouhani, the current president of Iran who has put economic growth above nuclear development and has created some positive interactions with Western powers (Powell). This
        multilateral deal involves not only the U.S., but also China, Russia, France, Germany, and the U.K. Since the Iran Nuclear Deal, Iran’s economy has started to improve, but soon after President Donald Trump became president of the U.S., he
        pulled the U.S. out of the deal and set sanctions against Iran. According to a New York Times article, President Rouhani of Iran has come out to announce that Iran would pump Uranium gas through over 1,000 centrifuges in order to pressure
        Europe to hold up their end of the deal and compensate Iran for sanctions President Trump imposed (Wolgelenter & Sanger). The deal was being abided by Iran, but now that their economy is hurting from sanctions that the United States has
        imposed, Iran is threatening to restart its nuclear weapon development. The Iran Nuclear Deal was succeeding in its mission to stall the progress of nuclear weapon development in Iran, but the U.S. backing out of the deal is hurting that
        progress.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>We need to seek more diplomatic opportunities like the Iran Nuclear Deal so that we can limit the threat Iran poses and strengthen relations with them. Iran does not have to be an enemy to the U.S., and the best course of
        action for dealing with Iran is through diplomacy. Aggression would only heighten tensions and increase the incentive for Iran to be a threat to us, and war would only lead to more devastation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>Since 9/11, we have already engaged in too many conflicts in the Middle East. According to a Forbes article, a study by Brown University shows that the funds spent on America’s post-9/11 wars total $5.9 trillion. The Bush
        Administration claimed that for the 2003 U.S. Invasion of Iraq, only $50 to $100 billion would be spent, which is clearly false considering the trillions we have spent, so we should not trust any promises of a “low cost” conflict with Iran
        that any present day officials present (Hartung). We have enough financial burden in the US already, and we do not need to fund any more unnecessary wars; wars that American troops have little to no purpose in dying for. Not only will
        avoiding conflict with Iran lessen future financial burden from war costs, but it will also prevent the death of thousands of Americans and thousands of Iranians. Choosing diplomacy is choosing life, and life should always be the choice we
        make over war.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>This understanding that diplomacy is the only viable option for dealing with Iran is followed by Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an ex-CIA member. Riedel worked with the CIA for almost thirty
        years, and much of his time was spent dealing with Iran. He was a senior advisor to Iran for three U.S. president, and has a large understanding of dealing with Middle East policy (Riedel & O’Hanlon). In his article, “American and Iran:
        Flawed Analysis, Missed Opportunities, and Looming Dangers,” Ridel offers multiple suggestions on how to proceed with Iran.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>He advises that we take a look at our rhetoric, saying, “Calm voices and frank assessments are better than heavy breathing and threats (Riedel).” He says to, “Keep the focus on their misdeeds, not our misspoken words,” and
        that passing resolutions through Congress at home is not policy (Riedel). We need to watch what we say about Iran, because the wrong words could hinder progress made towards diplomacy, and we need to have genuine policies for dealing with
        Iran.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>Regarding diplomacy, Riedel advises that we keep the focus on diplomacy. He advises, “Support academic exchanges and two-track diplomacy quietly, not as a stalking horse for regime change.” Two track diplomacy is defined as,
        “‘unofficial, informal interaction between members of adversary groups or nations that aim to develop strategies, to influence public opinion, organize human and material resources in ways that might help resolve their conflict’ (Mapendere).”
        Two-track diplomacy does not involve the use of formal diplomats, but allowing different people from the respective countries to interact. The purpose of the two-track diplomacy shouldn’t be to cause regime change in Iran, but to help improve
        our relationship with Iran. A possible example of how to further two-track diplomacy with Iran would be to invite one of their sports teams to play one of our teams, or inviting their scientists to a science fair, where information can be
        shared. Through this kind of diplomacy, the opinions of individuals can change, which could help the future of the political relationship between Iran and the United States.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>The last suggestion Riedel gives is to have a goal for the U.S. to, “...bring Iran back into the community of nations and to renew a direct dialogue with Tehran.” He stresses that thirty years have been long enough for our
        misdealings with Iran, and, “ We should renew the offer that President Bush’s father wisely put on the table in 1989: good will begets good will. The United States should be ready to sit down with Iran anytime, anywhere to discuss all the
        issues that divide us (Riedel).” Currently, our only line of communication with Iran is through the Swiss government, and Riedel suggests that by creating a direct line of communication with Tehran, diplomacy would be easier to conduct and
        yield greater interactions. Direct lines of communication could also prevent dangerous incidents in the Gulf between our navies (Riedel).</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container paragraph'>
      <p class='standard'>I believe there is a strong argument for encouraging diplomacy with Iran, despite history and barriers that may suggest otherwise. Diplomacy with Iran is the best way to prevent future conflicts and help improve our
        political relationship with Iran. for those who think diplomacy is a weak method of dealing with countries, it isn’t. In his paper, Riedel says, “ Diplomacy is not a sign of weakness; it is the mechanism by which states resolve the issues
        that divide them. As Winston Churchill famously put it, ‘To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.’” We should take the advice of Winston Churchill seriously and acknowledge that in every way, diplomacy is a better method to solving our
        issues and problems with Iran than any other possible solution. Diplomacy can give us the opportunity to solve our current problems and help prevent future ones that may come to light, such as Iranian development of nuclear weapons and an
        incident at sea between our navies. Regarding foreign policy with Iran, our government needs to be respectful and take advantage of all opportunities that could improve relations with Iran. It’s not only on the government, but it’s on us.
        Learn more about our history with Iran, and urge others to. Iran is not the boogey-man we make it out to be. By changing the hearts of the people, we can help the political relationship of our two countries prosper.</p>
